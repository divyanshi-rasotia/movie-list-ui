## ✅ How It Works

1. User sees a default background and minimal info.
2. When a user hovers over or clicks a movie card:
   - The background updates with a blurred poster.
   - The info panel populates with that movie’s data.
   - The card expands, while others shrink slightly.
3. The like button turns red when clicked.
